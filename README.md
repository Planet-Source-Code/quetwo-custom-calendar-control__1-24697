### Description

We were trying to create an application in a COM enabled programming envoriment, and needed the weeks shown in a calendar. We came across a bug in ALL of Microsoft's calendars (including Outlook) that will list the wrong week number on certain years. E.G. December 2003/2004. We made a custom VB OCX that does the trick, even thou it's not as pretty as the Microsoft one.
